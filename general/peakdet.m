function [maxtab, mintab]=peakdet(v, delta, x)
    %PEAKDET Detect peaks in a vector
    %        [MAXTAB, MINTAB] = PEAKDET(V, DELTA) finds the local
    %        maxima and minima ("peaks") in the vector V.
    %        MAXTAB and MINTAB consists of two columns. Column 1
    %        contains indices in V, and column 2 the found values.
    %
    %        With [MAXTAB, MINTAB] = PEAKDET(V, DELTA, X) the indices
    %        in MAXTAB and MINTAB are replaced with the corresponding
    %        X-values.
    %
    %        A point is considered a maximum peak if it has the maximal
    %        value, and was preceded (to the left) by a value lower by
    %        DELTA.
